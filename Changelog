      causing false negatives.
  * added the lizards data set.

bnlearn (1.1)
  * implemented mmpc().
  * slightly changed gaussian.test to be more learning-friendly.
  * fixed bugs in empty.graph() and "arcs<-"().
  * changed the default probability of arc inclusion for
      the "ordered" method in random.graph() to get sparser
      graphs.

  * implemented the possibility of not learning arc directions
      in constraint-based algorithms.
  * changed the default value of the strict parameter
      from TRUE to FALSE.
  * reimplemented cache.structure() in C to increase
      random.graph() performance and scalability.

bnlearn (1.0)

      different generation algorithms with custom tuning
      parameters.
  * moved to dynamic memory allocation in C routines.
  * improved performance and error handling of rbn().

bnlearn (0.9)
  * reimplemented all the functions that deal with cycles
      and paths in C, which increased their speed manifold
      and greatly improved their memory use.
  * cycle detection and elimination snow parallelized in
      gs(), iamb(), fast.iamb() and inter.iamb().
  * renamed {root,leaf}nodes() to {root,leaf}.nodes().
  * rewritten node ordering in C to improve performance
      and avoid recursion.
  * added ci.test(), which provides a fronted to all the
      independence and conditional independence tests
      implemented in the package.
  * added mutual information (for Gaussian data) and
      Pearson's X^2 tests (for discrete data).
  * removed the Mantel-Haenszel test.

bnlearn (0.8)

  * added support for random restarts in hc().
  * added arc.strength(), with support for both conditional
      independence tests and network scores.
  * added the asia data set.
  * lots of documentation updates.
  * reimplemented functions related to undirected arcs in C
      for speed.
  * added more parameter sanitization.

bnlearn (0.7)

  * optimized hc() via score caching, score equivalence,
    and partial reimplementation in C.
  * many utility functions' backends reimplemented in C
      for speed.
  * improved cycle and path detection.
  * lots of documentation updates.
  * added more parameter sanitization.

bnlearn (0.6)

  * ported Gaussian posterior density from the deal package.
  * added the gaussian.test data set.
  * added an AIC-based test for discrete data.
  * lots of documentation updates.
  * added more parameter sanitization.

bnlearn (0.5)

      leafnodes(), acyclic(), empty.graph() and random.graph().
  * reimplemented parents' configuration generation in C
      for speed.

  * added lots of parameter sanitization in utils-sanitization.R.

bnlearn (0.4)

  * added rbn(), with support for discrete data.
  * added a score function, with support for likelihood,
      loglikelihood, AIC, BIC, and posterior Dirichlet
      density of discrete networks.
  * ported modelstring(), a string representation of a network,
      from package deal.
  * added many utility functions, such as parents() and children()
     and their counterparts "parents<-"() and "children<-"().
