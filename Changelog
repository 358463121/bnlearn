      network conditional on its structure.

      lattice package.

bnlearn (1.4)
  * exported the "B" parameter to specify the number of
      permutations to be done in a permutation test.

      learning algorithms, as it was non-standard,
      misnamed and had various reported problems.

      included as data sets to the "network.scripts"
      directory.

      information (for both discrete and Gaussian data),
      Pearson's X^2, linear correlation and Fisher's Z.

      from TRUE to FALSE.

bnlearn (0.9)
  * reimplemented all the functions that deal with cycles
      and paths in C, which increased their speed manifold
      and greatly improved their memory use.
  * cycle detection and elimination snow parallelized in
      gs(), iamb(), fast.iamb() and inter.iamb().
  * renamed {root,leaf}nodes() to {root,leaf}.nodes().
  * rewritten node ordering in C to improve performance
      and avoid recursion.
  * added ci.test(), which provides a fronted to all the
      independence and conditional independence tests
      implemented in the package.
  * added mutual information (for Gaussian data) and
      Pearson's X^2 tests (for discrete data).
  * removed the Mantel-Haenszel test.
